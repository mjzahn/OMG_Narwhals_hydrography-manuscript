      "    summary: This dataset contains conductivity, temperature, pressure, and depth measurements from a CTD instrument that was attached to an ocean mooring. This dataset was collected by the Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) Narwhals program that will provide subannual hydrographic variability measurements in three northwest Greenland fjords. Between July 2018 to July 2020, three bottom-mounted moorings with a suite of instrumentation were deployed year-round in three glacial fjord sites in Melville Bay, West Greenland: Sverdrup Glacier, Kong Oscar Glacier, and Fisher Islands/Rink Glacier. Examination of water properties at these sites will demonstrate the presence and potential seasonality of warm, salty Atlantic Water intrusion into these marine-terminating glaciers. Additonally, during summer cruises where moorings were deployed and/or recovered, a CTD was lowered into the water to obtain full water column profiles at various locations near the glacier fronts and offshore.\n",
